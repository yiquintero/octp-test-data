In this simulation, transport properties of an equimolar mixture of water-methanol is computed at 298 K and 1 atm by using the commands provided by the OCTP plugin. The TraPPE united-atom force field is used for the methanol molecule combined with the SPC/E water model. These force field paramters are specified in the file "input_forcefield.data". The configuration of the system consisting of 250 water and 250 methanol molecules is provided in the file "input_data.system". The simulation procedure, which is the input to the LAMMPS executable file, is specified in the file "input_simulation.in".
